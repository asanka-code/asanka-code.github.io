    <h2>Readings</h2>

    <p>I would like to take this space to share important or interesting reading material that I believe worth sharing with others.</p>

    <ul>

	    <b><i>Peter Principle</i></b> is an interesting idea introduced by Laurence J. Peter in his book <i>The Peter Principle</i> (1969).

	    <b><i>Human creativity in the age of text generators</i></b> (2023) by Mark Dingemanse and Gijske de Boo. Quote: <i>"Just as there is value in stammering in a foreign language on the way to greater fluency, so there is value in grappling with complex ideas and struggling to put them into words. Removing that friction doesn’t smoothen the creative process — it makes it slip away. Perhaps the most important lesson from synthetic text generators, then, is that they show us, in photo negative, what it takes to really think together."</i> <a href="https://ideophone.org/human-creativity-in-the-age-of-text-generators" target="_blank">[Read Original]</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240604061006/https://ideophone.org/human-creativity-in-the-age-of-text-generators" target="_blank">[Read on archive.org]</a>
